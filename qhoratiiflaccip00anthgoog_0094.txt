Cuningam entered the lists with an edition printed at the
ἔξω. }Hague, avon. 8vo. and reprinted the same year at the Lon·
don prees. Cuningarn boasts 01 having corrected the text in
upwards os 400 places3 and so great was his opposition and
animosity, to Bentley, that, whenever he discovered thathe
had adopted any 011001 his readings, is it was supported by
any other authority, he would consess his obligatior to that
¹ authority rather thau to Bentley's3 while, is he had followed
any emendation 01 ¹the great critic's, 101 which he had no

authority, thoughcver so much pleased with it, he would, in 1

many cases, immediately reject it, in order 10 avoid acknow· ἶ

ledging himself under any obligation to the learning 01 the l

scholar whom he attached. Hence the edition 01 Cuningam,

though in many respecta a valuable one, is by no means enti·
tled to the praise which Kett bestows on it (alemena, rol. 2.
p. 531.), when he states that “every page evinces the learned
editor's critical sagacity and excellent judgment.” Every Ἴ
tpage, on the contrary, displays his malignantanry and obsti· ,
nate prejudice. Among the remaining editions 01 this ceu· 1
tury, the most worthy 01 notice are the following: that 01
