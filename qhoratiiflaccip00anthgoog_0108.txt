. translations are spirited and elegant, though, on the whole,
they suffer bya comparison with those ol Francis. The cri·
tical notes have been chiefly copied lrom Dacier.

Christopher Smart had turned Horace into prose 3 but al-
terwards, thinking that this translation might be injurians to
his memory‚ he detenniued to wn'te one in verse, whichwas
pubhshed at London‚ with the Latin text ς but, on again con-
sidering that his work might become a school-book, and eonse-
quently the sale be increased, he fonned the resolution to re·
vise the prose translation, and print it at the foot ol the page.

, This resolution he executed in the edition of 1767?

⁸1·- In 1783, appeared from the London press, a translation ol

· thedrt of Poetry by George Colman. Its menits will suffi-
ciently appear from the following remarks :·-“ It is not only
for the 'happy exphoation of this exquisite poem, wlrich will
now no longer be considered, as it hitherto has been, an ⁴ op·
probrium criticum,’ that the classical reader is indebted to ΜΓ.

’ Colman. He will receive equal gratification from his admira-

ble translation of it, which is indeed a masterpiece in its 3
kind.'’ (Montttyltevtew, Aug. 1783. p. 144-8.) Os this ²
same version Ha'rles observes: “Colman vero illam, quae
elegans esse dicitur, versionem, iambis similiter desinentibus
expressam, iterum recepit emendatiorem, cum textu latino χ
aliisque opusculis in tertio tomo operis ε Prosc on several oc· ³

The most recent translation of the whole works of Horace

⁰² in verse'is that byBoscawen1793-97. “This translation,’'
says the author ol the Pursuits os Literature, “has had the
usual fate of mediocrity.'' ln 1795, Wakefield publisheda
version ol the Odes, in his Poetical Translations hom the An·
cients. 'l'he perimmensa however, is one of no verypeeuliar
merit.

With regard to the English prose translations, as that of
Smart has already been mentioned, it remains but to notice t
the versione of Watson and Stirling. 'llhe former was pub l
lished in 1741, from¹ the london press, in 9 vols. Svo, and
republlshed in 1747, 1750, 1760, and 1799. “ This? observes
