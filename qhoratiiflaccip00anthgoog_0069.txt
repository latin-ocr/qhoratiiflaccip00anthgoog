lambio verses take tbair name soom the lambris,l which, in puro lam·
hies, was the only foot admitted. They are scanned by moaorres of two
leet3 and it was asaal, in reoiting them, to rnalro a short pause at the end
of every second sont, with an eihphaffrs (orsis) on its final syllable. ·

The lambio Trimeter (called liltewise Senonas, from its' containing aix
feet) oonahts of three moerores (merch 'l'he leet which compose it, six
in number, ane properly all iambi3 in which oaae, as above stated, the line
is called apnre iambio. The oaesural pause most commonly oooara at the

, 'l'he metros here end respectively where the double lines are marked,
and the oaesural pause takes place at the middle ol the third foot, atter the
word ille, ,

'l'he pure lambio, however, was rarely used. Thia menas to hare been
owing partly to the very great difficulty oi producing any considerable
number oi good verses, and partly to the wisb os giving to tbe verae a
greater degree of weight aad dignity.¹ ln consequence of this, the spondeo
was allowed to take the plaoe of the iambus in the first, third, and fifth
feet³ Tho admission ol the apondee pared the way sor other innovatione.
Thoe, the double time os ono long syllable was divided into two single
times, or two short syllables· Hence, for the iambus, of three times, war
substitutod a tribraoh, in every smtion except tbe' sixtb, because there the

final syllable being lengthened by the longer pause at the termination ol
