ed to the testimony of Suetonius, has indnoed many antiquarios to irua-
gine, that at some periodon other of his life he possessed a little villa in
its neighbourhood 3 and tradition accordingly cnnoblcs a few scettered frag·
ments of walls and arches with the interesting appellation of Horace’s
villa 'l'he site is indeed worthy of the poet, where, defended by asenni-
circular range of wooded mountains hom every cold blustering wind, he
might lools down on the playful windings of the Anio below, discover nu·
merops rills gleuming through the thickets as they glidcd down tbc oppo
site bank, enjoya lirll view of the splendid mansion of his friend Maece-
nas rising directly before him, and catch a distant perspective of Aurea
Rostro, of the golden towers of the Capitol sp-anng majestic on its distant
rnount. But whatever his wishes might be, it is not probable that his mo
derate income permitted him to enioy such aluxurious residence in a
place so much frequented, and consequently ‚so very eppensive3 and in·
deed the very mannerin which those wishes are expressed, seems to imply
but slight hopes of ever being able to recline them. “ Tuber, dra sit-sti-
nom-Unde ,si-Parcae prohibent inipuoe.” lf , Horace actually possess
ed ovilla theri, the wish was unneoessor'y, astho event lay in bis own
power. The authority of Suetonius seems indeed positive, bitir is possi-
ble that the same place may be alluded founder the double appellation of
his Sabine or Tiburtino sent. 'l'he poet, it is inre, osten represents himself
psmeditoting his compositions while he wandered along the plains and
¹through the gmves of Tibur 3

But as he was probablyafreqrient companion of Maecenas in his excur-
siousto his villa at'l'ibur, hemay in those lines allude to hissolittry ram·
bles and poetical reveries.” ’

Totbe'same effect arethe remmks of a more recent traveller. ·“ l see
little resson to imagine,'’ observes the writer just olluded to,⁴ “ that Ho-
race everhad a villa at Tibur3 for he was poor, and bis Sabine farm was
only twelve miles off ; aud when lte resided antido the mannes of Tibur,
it was probably at the country-homes of Maecenas ond bis other friends?
