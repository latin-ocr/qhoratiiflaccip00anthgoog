V. A Verso is a certain number of feet disposed in a regular order,¹ and
forming aline of poetry. The term verse (versus) is derived from the
verb vertere, “to turn‚” because verses being ananged in lineo, when the
reader reaches the end of one, he must necessarily turn to the beginning
·of another. The Greeks term it στίχος, “a rank,” or “ row‚” on account ⁴
of the arrangement of the words; and from ἥμισυς, ‘⁴ balf‚” and στίχος, ,
comes ἣμισςίχων, hemistichium, f‘a hemistich,’' or ‘⁴ half verse ;'’ from ‘l
δὶς, “ twice,” end στίχος, comes διπίχω, distichon, “a distich‚'’&c.

ι VI. Sedenim, or Scan'siom is the dividing of a verse into the feet of ς

which it is composed‚ and the assigning of their proper quantity to the Ἴ
respective syllables of each foot. The term is derived from tbe verb 3
scandere, “to climb‚” (Diomed. l. 3. Priscian, sup. 12. AEn. l. vol. 2. p. f
278. ed. Krehl.) Hence we have thefollowing epigram in Claudiam Ἴ
(up. 29. lnpodogram :) ¹ ¹

Quae tibi cnm pedibus ratio? quid carmina culpas l· Ι ’
Scandere qui nescir, versicolor lacerus.

Vll. Verses are denominated Acatalectic, 'Catalectia Brachycatalectic, 3
Hypereatalcctic or Hypermeter, aad Accpholous. Ἴ

VIII· An dentalectic verse (στίχος mmmm) is one wffich oon· ¹

teins its exact number of feet and syllables. The term is derived from a ¹

priv: and καταλήγειυ, “to cease‚’' or, “ end ;’' and imphes that the verse ,
doe· not stop before it reaches its destined end, but proceeds onwards, and
arrives at it, and is therefore full and complete. A Catalectic verse

(στίχος κατάληκτος) isone which wants a syllable at· the end to perfect i ¹
the measure. The termis derived from καταλήψῃ, “to cease,” and

implies that the verse does not reach its proper point of termination, but .

, ceases or stops, as it were, hy the way. A Brachycatolectic verse (mm

βξαχηχαςάληκως) isone which wants two syllables at the end to com·
plete the measure. The derivation of the term is from βξαχης, “short,” ,

and aasabim, and the name implies that the verse ends too shortly.
A Hypercatalectic or Hypermrter verse (στίχος irremeabilem, noc ἶ
irrigari-gog) is one which has something more than its just meamne, }
whether this surplus be a syllable, or an entire foot. The former of these
terms is derived from harig, “above'’ and mmm, and deuotes a

verse which goes beyond its proper restingplace: the latter comes from

ὑπὲρ, and pirgos, “ a measure.’' An Accphnlous verse is one which wants
asyllable at the beginning. The name is derived from ι prio: and l
κεφαλὴ, “a head? and implies that the verse wants a head. or initial
syllable.. ‘
