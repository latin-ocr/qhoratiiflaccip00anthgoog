'l’he next division o l'rhythm rs es one to two; this corresponds with
our triple time, or three crotohets tos bar, contahting a quantity ol which
one part is the double of the other. of this nahue are the leet called
iambi, trocheus, sud tribracis. ,

The third division ol rhythmis as two to three. This division of time
is not used ιιι modern music, but may be expressed by five crotchets to a
ber, of which three, as one part, would be as muchand half as much
ιςιὶιιιι the other. Of this nature is the loot called Paeon, such as trusti-
ιίᾱ, consisting ol one long, and three short times, or of five short times
This rhythrn rs called by the Greeks ἡμιόλιρς, by the Latias sesquialter
orneacusplen.

The fourth division os rhythra is as three to four, which is also unknown
in modern music, but may be represented hy seven crotchets to a bar,
divided into four end three, where the greater quantity is to the less as the
whole audone third over. This rhythmis called hythe Greeks ἐςιςμςος
and hythe Latins sesquitertius, οι supertes-tius. of this rhythmis the word
rq‘hrsntdo, consisting ol one short end three long times, or ol seven short

times.

..xn It must be distinctly understood, however,l thuwords which have
the same general rhythm, and are isochronous in collective value as
stwords, are by no means also isochronous as feet, and interchangeahle
whenever, the metre allows of isochronous interchanges. For instance,
the ίαιιιίιιιι and trocheo, ss we have seen above, fall under the sarm rule
of rhythm, are equally examples of double-propertius, thetis, of the
proportion of one to tw0, eud yet they not only cannot be substituted one
for the other, but are said to have an antipathy (ἀντιπάσχειν), οι, in other
words to he of a nature directly opposite to each other. The reason
appears to be this: as rhythm is divided into feet, so feet are again subdi·
