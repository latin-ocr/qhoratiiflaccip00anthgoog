great velue, since it exhibita many excellent readings which either occuri ¹

in ιιο other Μ88., or else ιιι very few. We ought not to omit, however,
in this enumeration of Jani'a ‘⁶ amada? the Franker MS, remarkable aa
well for its age, as for the 'number of inedited scholia which ιι contains.

The Stra'aburgh Μ88. of which Oberlin made> use in preparlng his
splendid edition, were four in number. They do not appear to have been
of any very great value. Two belonged to privata individuah3 the ramam
y ing' two wera contained inthc hbrary of the college. .

Jaeclt’s recent edition of Horace professes tobe based upon the readings ,

¹ af sur Bamberg Μ88. never before employed ιιι aettling the text of the
poet. They donot appear, however, ιο beentrtlcd ιο any very pemilinn
priiiihe old MSS. of Horace, the text was generally, ifnot universally,
accompanied with a very copious marginal commentary, and tomake
roomfor this, tha space allowed for the Latin verses was too much coa·

tracted. The commencement, likewise, of'a new ode or cpistle was

hequently decorated with illuminatione, which, by also occupying a
portion· of space, tended still more to limit that which was reserved for

the text. 'Phe transcriber,.ia consequence, frequently found that one verse.
of the poem could not, ιιι writing, be contained in one line of his paper,

but that a partof a verse must necessarily be carried on to a aecond3 and, ,

ashe was not sufficiendyakilful to ducem where each verse properly
termmated, the commencenrcnt of a new one was not marked by a capital< ,
letter, or any other distinction. Hence the confiuion introduced in the· ’
arene of the lines, and the disputes with regard ιο their division Α Some·
times, too, the copyistswrote hrreswithout the firstlettars, intending astar·- ,
warda to emblaaon them, which in many instanoes was forgottenentirely« ι

Thus,in the teth hnc of the first ode of the first book :-

Ma dictarum hederae praemiasrontium,

the first letter was left blank m the oldest Μ88., and the ward Te was
adopted by conjecture, in the ancient editions, till Rutgersius proposed an

alteration to Me,- which correction ha's been admitted ιιι almost all the·

impressione published since his time3 though Dr. Hare attempted to
justify and revive theold reading of Te.
With regard ιο ancient Μ88. generally,.it may not be amisa to mention

in this place the chief results, as to their distinctiva marks, which bave

been obtained from an examination of them*
