1. Metre, ur its most extensive sense meansanarrangement ol syllables
andfcet rn verse, accordingto certain nrlesr and, ur tlris seuse,applies110t
only to an entire verse, but to a part of a verse, or any number ol

verses. But o metra, ina specific sense, means a eombination of tvvo feet,
aud sometimes one foot only.

lumbis, Tracheia, Choriumbs'c aud Ιοιιιο.

“ 111. These have received their respective names nom the frequent
occurrence in each of them of some particular foot; arrd it has been
thought that each species was originally composed of those feet only from

bic, and Trochaic verse, therefore, amonometer will eontain two seete
dimeter four, a trimeter six, &cr whereas, in the other speeies of verses
monometer will contain only one foot, adimeter two feet, atrimeter three, .
&a Some grammarians, in speaking of Anapaestic, lambio, and Troehaic
verse, use the term dipodio (laralia) instead of moire, arrd, inplaee of
ἵ calling a verse monometer, describe it as consisting of one dipodius ·
